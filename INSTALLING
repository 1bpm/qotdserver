qotdserver 1.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Richard Knight


Run the usuals:
    make
    make install (as root)

This will compile and install qotdserver to /usr/sbin/qotdserver, along with 
the default config at /etc/qotdserver.conf

A postgresql database should be created and then create_table.sql executed 
within. A specific user with permissions to select from the quote table should 
be set up, for example with the following commands:
        
    CREATE USER qotdserver ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'db_password';
    GRANT SELECT ON quote TO qotdserver;

This creates the database with a couple of thousand example quotes. In order to
change/add quotes, refer to README.

Edit /etc/qotdserver.conf, changing the parameters in the database section to
reflect the postgresql account.

The day parameter in the general section specifies the mode of operation as an
integer, which can be:
    0 : New quote on connection
    1 : New quote each day (reset at 00:00)
