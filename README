qotdserver 1.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Richard Knight


Implementation of RFC865: TCP quote of the day server, using a postgresql 
database for quote retrieval and threaded connection handling.



EXAMPLE QUOTES
A couple of thousand quotes are included in the create_db.sql script. These 
have been scraped from some websites and in general contain a lot of profanity,
potentially transgressive content and edginess. If that's a problem, don't
use them.



CHANGING / ADDING QUOTES
When installed, the database table used features three notable columns: quote,
author and source. Quote must always be present, but author and source are
optional.
Insert new quotes to the database with a statement such as the following:

    INSERT INTO quote (quote, author, source, created)
    VALUES ('Yes, it is Friday', 'T. Westwood', 'The Ether', current_timestamp);

created and the value current_timestamp are optional and currently just exist
to log when a new quote was inserted to the database.    
 

INIT
There is no init script at the moment so you will need to create your own, 
add to rc.local (or similar), or start manually.
