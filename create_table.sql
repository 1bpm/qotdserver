His other hand stroked the top of her head, his fingers tangling through her soft hair.

551	"The question, from pundits and constituents, was obvious and loud: If you aren't transparent, what are you hiding? Though some citizens and commentators objected on grounds of privacy, asserting that government, at virtually every level, had always needed to do some things in private for the sake of security and efficiency, the momentum crushed all such arguments and the progression continued. If you weren't operating in the light of day, what were you doing in the shadows?"	Dave Eggers	The Circle	2019-01-02 04:19:59.979579

It was about something more: about the self, and where you kept it, and who, if anyone, was allowed to fully see it."	Julian Barnes	The Only Story	2019-01-02 04:20:06.464404

602	"[L]ike poems, cruising carves privacy out of public spaces. Poems are a kind of private communication that occurs in public speech.

611	"Tact by its nature entails staying mum, prudently electing to forgo urging other people to pursue an alternative course of action. Creation of silent spaces in our own life and equitable distribution of periods of respite that allow for periods of equable inner reflection is necessary to spur personal growth.

907	"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards. I wish I could just slip up and down the timeline as I pleased. It's almost what I do anyway."	Zachary Mason	Void Star	2019-01-02 04:22:13.568294
909	"We want villains. We look for them everywhere. People to pin our misfortunate on. Whose sins and flaws are responsible for all the suffering we see. We want a world where the real monstrosity lies in wicked individuals. Instead of being a fundamental facet of human society, of the human heart.   Stories prime us to search for villains. Because villains can be punished. Villains can be stopped.  But villains are oversimplifications."	Sam J. Miller	Blackfish City	2019-01-02 04:22:16.139694

911	"Technology isn't rational; with luck, it's a runaway horse, foaming at the mouth, ready to throw itself off a cliff in desperation. Our problem is that culture's tied to that horse."	MartÃ­n Felipe Castagnet	Los cuerpos del verano	2019-01-02 04:22:16.653867

913	"Death still exists; what has disappeared is the certainty that everything will eventually end sooner or later. There's time to shave your head, time to let the gray hairs grow, time to get pregnant, to torture, to be the world champion, and to rewrite the encyclopedia. With patience, a single person could build the pyramids; with perseverance, another single person could knock them down. I guess destruction is another form of love."

917	"thereâs something unnatural about the feelings we have for people whoâve hurt us. About hate. Itâs a connection. We want to know if theyâre alive or dead, where they are in the world. As much as their faces bring terror, that part of us that allowed them to hurt us in the first place still hungers."	Alex Livingston	Glitch Rain	2019-01-02 04:22:18.362954
918	"...as my fist drove through her ribs. Bone cracked. Shifted. The numbers in my optics hit steel-bending digits and Muerte lost her footing.

921	"...given that the approval process is costly, the debate is linked to the middle and upper classes. As a general rule, the greater the annual income, the less respect for a body. Millionaires setting fire to themselves bonzo style just to keep anyone from reusing their bodies seem to have created a tradition as esteemed as caviar."

922	"I take his hand, but it's not the hand I held when he was the size of guinea pig recently issued from his mother's womb. This body isn't right.

927	"Multicolored pipes vein the outside of every building in a dense varicose web: crimson chrome for heat, dark olive for potable water, mirror black for sewage.

928	"Itâs an open secret that the sneakernet is used for a lot more than moving a few dozen terabytes more quickly than you could across the lines. The kids â "chucks" in local argot â pick up your external drive and walk it to wherever you want to send it. Along the way they add on a few other jobs, like grabbing prepaids from some chick and delivering them to the person she owes. Most of the industry uses them."

932	"Bodybreaking, they called it. What happened when the breaks finally killed you. The moment your mind's hold on the here and now finally ruptured forever and you broke free from your body."	Sam J. Miller	Blackfish City	2019-01-02 04:22:22.222438
933	"...the most myth-shrouded story of all is that of the nanobonded. A whole community of people who were either deliberately or accidentally exposed to the experimental wireless nanomachines that established one-to-one networks between individuals, and who, through years of training and imprinting, could "network" themselves to animals, forming primal emotional connections so that they could control their animals through thought alone."

937	"Becoming real simply because he'd appeared on a few thousand TV screens. Growing up with a sense that media events were real, and personal events were not. Anything that didn't happen on television didn't happen. Even as he hated conventional programming, even as he regarded it as the cud of ruminants, still it defined his sense of personal unreality; and left him unfinished."

947	"Najia can feel yts subdermal activators against her forearm. Not man not woman not both not neither. Nute. Another way of being human, speaking a phsyical language she does not understand.

Or a lover."	Ian McDonald	River of Gods	2019-01-02 04:22:28.468344
948	"The implants just give you a new set of reproductive-free imperatives, that's all. The rest, thank the gods, is up to you. They wouldn't be worth anything if they didn't give rise to the most troubling and complex problems of the heart. They are what makes all this glory, this madness worthwhile.

953	"...it changes the central fact of the human condition: that each of us lives behind one set of eyes, and not another; that our own pain is an agony, and another's pain only an abstraction we believe in by an act of faith.

970	"Machinic desire can seem a little inhuman, as it rips up political cultures, deletes traditions, dissolves subjectivities, and hacks through security apparatuses, tracking a soulless tropism to zero control. This is because what appears to humanity as the history of capitalism is an invasion from the future by an artificial intelligent space that must assemble itself entirely from its enemy's resources."

989	"You think we have a connection because of all the things you've sucked out of my mind by screening, but that isn't real. Trust comes when you've worked with someone for years; it doesn't speed up just because you can think fast, and it doesn't materialize when you stick a cable in someone's head.

1465	"You've always lived a life of pretense, not a real life-- a simulated existence, not a genuine existence. Everything about you, everything you are, has always been pretense, never genuine, never real."	Thomas Bernhard	Woodcutters	2019-01-02 04:34:58.349184
1470	"Does something which exists on the edge have no true relevance to the stable center, or does it, by being on the edge, become a part of the edge and thus a part of the boundary, the definition which gives the whole its shape?"	Lucy Grealy	\N	2019-01-02 04:34:59.625785
1471	"A scientist can pretend that his work isn't himself, it's merely the impersonal truth. An artist can't hide behind the truth. He can't hide anywhere."	Ursula K. LeGuin	The Dispossessed	2019-01-02 04:34:59.883927

1475	"Long looking at paintings is equivalent to being dropped into a foreign city, where gradually, out of desire and despair, a few key words, then a little syntax make a clearing in the silence. Art... is a foreign city, and we deceive ourselves when we think it familiar... We have to recognize that the language of art, all art, is not our mother-tongue."	Jeanette Winterson	Art Objects: Essays on Ecstasy and Effrontery	2019-01-02 04:35:00.916274
1476	"Art is whether or not there is a scream in him wanting to get out in a special way."	Chaim Potok	My Name Is Asher Lev	2019-01-02 04:35:01.171365
1477	"Creating is living doubly. The groping, anxious quest of a Proust, his meticulous collecting of flowers, of wallpapers, and of anxieties, signifies nothing else."	Albert Camus	The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays	2019-01-02 04:35:01.426513

1484	"I have no duty to be anyone's Friend and no man in the world has a duty to be mine. No claims, no shadow of necessity. Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival."	C.S. Lewis	The Four Loves	2019-01-02 04:35:04.925326
1485	"The artist, and particularly the poet, is always an anarchist in the best sense of the word. He must heed only the call that arises within him from three strong voices: the voice of death, with all its foreboding, the voice of love and the voice of art."

1488	"It is in dialogue with pain that many beautiful things acquire their value. Acquaintance with grief turns out to be one of the more unusual prerequisites of architectural appreciation. We might, quite aside from all other requirements, need to be a little sad before buildings can properly touch us."	Alain de Botton	The Architecture of Happiness	2019-01-02 04:35:05.952317

1491	"This pause in time, within time ... When did I first experience the exquisite sense of surrender that is only possible with another person? The peace of mind one experiences on one's own, one's certainty of self in the serenity of solitude, are nothing in comparison to the release and openness and fluency one shares with another, in close companionship ..."	Muriel Barbery	The Elegance of the Hedgehog	2019-01-02 04:35:06.72714
1492	"One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought."	Albert Einstein	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:06.984961

1495	"Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."	Kurt Vonnegut	A Man Without a Country	2019-01-02 04:35:07.75784
1496	"Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future."	Albert Camus	The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays	2019-01-02 04:35:08.015015

1504	"We feel lonely now and then and long for friends and think we should be quite different and happier if we found a friend of whom we might say: âHe is the one.â But you, too, will begin to learn that there is much self-deception behind this longing; if we yielded too much to it, it would lead us from the road."	Vincent van Gogh	Complete Letters of Vincent Van Gogh	2019-01-02 04:35:10.078299
1505	"A week after my drugs ran out, I left my bed to perform at the college, deciding at the last minute to skip both the doughnut toss and the march of the headless plush toys.

1519	"It is a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me. I assure you, dear friend, no one has given so much care to the study of composition as I.

1520	"To be an outlaw you must first have a base in law to reject and get out of, I never had such a base. I never had a place I could call home that meant any more than a key to a house, apartment or hotel room. â¦ Am I alien? Alien from what exactly? Perhaps my home is my dream city, more real than my waking life precisely because it has no relation to waking lifeâ¦"	William S. Burroughs	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:16.098783

1524	"There is no excuse for anyone to write fiction for public consumption unless he has been called to do so by the presence of a gift.

1533	"Watch a French housewife as she makes her way slowly along the loaded stallsâ¦ searching for the peak of ripeness and flavorâ¦ What you are seeing is a true artist at work, patiently assembling all the materials of her craft, just as the painter squeezes oil colors onto his palette ready to create a masterpiece."

1543	"After all, what is art? Art is the creative process and it goes through all fields. Einsteinâs theory of relativity â now that is a work of art!

1558	"From now on I hope always to stay alert, to educate myself as best I can. But lacking this, in Future I will relaxedly turn back to my secret mind to see what it has observed when I thought I was sitting this one out. We never sit anything out.

Nikki Rowe	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:30.326339
1563	"The tools are real. The viewer is real, you, the artist, is real and a part of everything you paint. You connect yourself to the viewer by sharing something that is inside of you that connects with something inside of him. All you have as your guide is that you know what moves you. All you have to do it with is a brush, some chemical and canvas, and technique."	Steven Brust	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:30.90456

1565	"Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly."	Italo Calvino	Invisible Cities	2019-01-02 04:35:31.502624

1576	"For so many years, I couldnât understand why every time I thought that someone finally loved me, likeâ¦ for real, they would eventually turn to vapor.

1580	"The arts are not just a nice thing to have or to do if there is free time or if one can afford it. Rather, paintings and poetry, music and fashion, design and dialogue, they all define who we are as a people and provide an account of our history for the next generation."	Michelle Obama	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:38.129172
1581	"Every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression. The chasm is never completely bridged.

1582	"In art, and maybe just in general, the idea is to be able to be really comfortable with contradictory ideas. In other words, wisdom might be, seem to be, two contradictory ideas both expressed at their highest level and just let to sit in the same cage sort of, vibrating. So, I think as a writer, I'm really never sure of what I really believe."	George Saunders	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:38.740211

1585	"She was never going to seek gainful employment again, that was for certain. She'd remain outside the public sector. She'd be an anarchist, she'd travel with jaguars. She was going to train herself to be totally irrational. She'd fall in love with a totally inappropriate person. She'd really work on it, but abandon would be involved as well. She'd have different names, a.k.a. Snake, a.k.a. Snow - no that was juvenile. She wanted to be extraordinary, to possess a savage glitter."	Joy Williams	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:39.754809
1586	"Provided we can escape from the museums we carry around inside us, provided we can stop selling ourselves tickets to the galleries in our own skulls, we can begin to contemplate an art which re-creates the goal of the sorcerer: changing the structure of reality by the manipulation of living symbols ... Art tells gorgeous lies that come true."	Hakim Bey	TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone	2019-01-02 04:35:40.101554
1587	"Friendship is an obstetric art; it draws out our richest and deepest resources; it unfolds the wings of our dreams and hidden indeterminate thoughts; it serves as a check on our judgements, tries out our new ideas, keeps up our ardor, and inflames our enthusiasm."

1597	"This is the time for every artist in every genre to do what he or she does loudly and consistently. It doesn't matter to me what your position is. You've got to keep asserting the complexity and the originality of life, and the multiplicity of it, and the facets of it. This is about being a complex human being in the world, not about finding a villain. This is no time for anything else than the best that you've got."	Toni Morrison	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:43.533174

1601	"Through its creative power, art may trigger approximation, reconciliation and harmonization between individuals and peoples. Through art, beings can meet and exchange their points of view, as it rules out alienation, and arouses chemistry and understanding. By definition, art is universal and helps to cross borders and barriers without prejudice."	Erik Pevernagie	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:44.850914
1602	"Some donât even watch art with their eyes nor with their mind, but with their ears, ever since they judge art by the sound of money. ( âMoney rocking and rollingâ)"	Erik Pevernagie	\N	2019-01-02 04:35:45.196764

1705	"Whatever the source of emotion that drives me to create, I want to give it a form which has some connection with the visible world, even if it is only to wage war on that world....I want my paintings to be able to defend themselves to resist the invader, just as though there were razor blades on all surfaces so no one could touch them without cutting his hands."

1719	"Well, life isn't a cakewalk, is it?! Eighty-nine percent of the world's most valuable art was created by men living in rat-infested flats. You think VelÃ¡squez wore Adidas? You think he enjoyed the luxuries of central heating and twenty-four-hour pizza delivery?!"	Marisha Pessl	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:25.4044
1720	"What's with the serum?" I don't know, but it sounds ominous. We better put a telepathic direction finder on Benway. The man's not to be trusted.

1729	"Who but the artist has the power to open man up, to set free the imagination? The others - priest, teacher, saint, statesman, warrior - hold us to the path of history.

1755	"What I love about the sculpture is that it makes the bones that we are always walking and playing on manifest, like in a world that so often denies the reality of death and the reality that we are surrounded by and outnumbered by the dead. Here, is a very playful way of acknowledging that and acknowledging that and that always, whenever we play, whenever we live, we are living in both literal and metaphorical ways on the memory and bones of the dead."	John Green	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:38.61963

1772	"Photography is essentially an act of recognition by street photographers, not an act of invention. Photographers might respond to an old manâs face, or an Arbus freak, or the way light hits a buildingâand then they move on. Whereas in all the other art forms, take William Blake, everything that came to that paper never existed before. Itâs the idea of alchemy, of making something from nothing."

Steven Pressfield	The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles	2019-01-02 04:36:48.194802
1787	"There is something beautiful about a blank canvas, the nothingness of the beginning that is so simple and breathtakingly pure. Itâs the paint that changes its meaning and the hand that creates the story. Every piece begins the same, but in the end they are all uniquely different."	Piper Payne	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:48.727439

1791	"It is only in his work that an artist can find reality and satisfaction, for the actual world is less intense than the world of his invention and consequently his life, without recourse to violent disorder, does not seem very substantial. The right condition for him is that in which his work in not only convenient but unavoidable."	Tenessee Williams	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:49.754822
1821	"The artist is a collector of things imaginary or real. He accumulates things with the same enthusiasm that a little boy stuffs his pockets. The scrap heap and the museum are embraced with equal curiosity. He takes snapshots, makes notes and records impressions on tablecloths or newspapers, on backs of envelopes or matchbooks. Why one thing and not another is part of the mystery, but he is omnivorous."	Paul Rand	Paul Rand: A Designer's Art	2019-01-02 04:36:59.54368

1797	"Beauty may no longer be what it was before. It has become suspect and many have dethroned it from its art pedestal. A lot of questions are raised: "When" is art?", "What" is art?", "Can this be art?

1809	"This is the theoryâ¦ that anything that is artâ¦ is presumably about some certain thing, but is really always about something else, and itâs no good having one without the other, because if you just have the something it is boring and if you just have the something else itâs irritating."

1811	"The right art," cried the Master, "is purposeless, aimless! The more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede. What stands in your way is that you have a much too willful will. You think that what you do not do yourself does not happen."	Eugen Herrigel	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:54.949117

1818	"Does our purpose on Earth directly link to the people whom we end up meeting? Are our relationships and experiences actually the required dots that connect and then lead us to our ultimate destinies?"	Jennifer Elisabeth	Born Ready: Unleash Your Inner Dream Girl	2019-01-02 04:36:58.771349
1819	"To my mind, a picture should be something pleasant, cheerful, and pretty, yes pretty! There are too many unpleasant things in life as it is without creating still more of them."	Pierre-Auguste Renoir	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:59.028615
1820	"Without atmosphere a painting is nothing."	Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn	\N	2019-01-02 04:36:59.283513
1823	"He possessed the logic of all good intentions and a knowledge of all the tricks of his trade, and yet he never succeeded at anything, because he believed too much in the impossible. Surprising? Why so? He was forever in the act of conceiving it!"	Charles Baudelaire	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:00.239354

1827	"And I bet it's harder than people think, isn't it? Everything looks so simple from a distance. Then, the more you look, the more you see. And that's when you have to rise to the challenge."	Laura Pritchett	Sky Bridge	2019-01-02 04:37:01.826817
1828	"We're artists too, but we do a good job hiding it, don't we?"	Roberto BolaÃ±o	The Savage Detectives	2019-01-02 04:37:02.081894
1829	"He realised, more vividly than ever before, that art had two constant, two unending preoccupations: it is always meditating upon death and it is always thereby creating life."	Boris Pasternak	Doctor Zhivago	2019-01-02 04:37:02.341427
1830	"Thereâs something about being naÃ¯ve. Really interesting things come because you donât know what the rules are, what you can and canât do."	Steve Buscemi	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:02.604309

1835	"We are liable to miss the best of life if we do not know how to tingle, if we do not learn to hoist ourselves just a little higher than we generally are in order to sample the rarest and ripest fruit of art which human thought has to offer."	Vladimir Nabokov	Look at the Harlequins!	2019-01-02 04:37:03.951281
1836	"She soon learned, though, that giving weight to other people's opinions was creative nihilism; it was like being banished from the Land of No Words and exiled to the Land of All Bullshit."	Stephanie Kallos	Broken for You	2019-01-02 04:37:04.207967
1837	"Art is a kind of mining," he said. "The artist a variety of prospector searching for the sparkling silver of meaning in the earth."	Jane Urquhart	The Underpainter	2019-01-02 04:37:04.471146
1838	"I believe that if it were left to artists to choose their own labels, most would choose none."	Ben Shahm	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:04.739233
1839	"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors."	Oscar Wilde	The Picture of Dorian Gray	2019-01-02 04:37:04.998688

1844	"Without poets, without artists... everything would fall apart into chaos. There would be no more seasons, no more civilizations, no more thought, no more humanity, no more life even; and impotent darkness would reign forever. Poets and artists together determine the features of their age, and the future meekly conforms to their edit."	Guillaume Apollinaire	Selected Writings	2019-01-02 04:37:08.593096

Arthur Conan Doyle	Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories, Volume I	2019-01-02 04:37:09.120174
1847	"I am the foremost collector of velvet Elvii in the city of Chicago," I said at once.   "Elvii?" Marcone inquired.  "The plural would be Elvises, I guess," I said.

1848	"If poets often commit suicide, it is not because their poems are bad but because they are good. Whoever heard of a bad poet committing suicide? The reader is only a little better off. The exhilaration of a good poem lasts twenty minutes, an hour at most.  Unlike the scientist, the artist has reentry problems that are frequent and catastrophic."	Walker Percy	Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book	2019-01-02 04:37:09.638341
1849	"Do you know that every great thing in the history of art and every beautiful thing in life is actually what you call nasty or has been caused by feelings that you would call nasty? By passion, by love, by hatred, by truth. Do you know that?"	John Fowles	The Collector	2019-01-02 04:37:09.892342

1863	"If the painter wishes to see beauties that charm him, it lies in his power to create them, and if he wishes to see monstrosities that are frightful, ridiculous, or truly pitiable, he is lord and God thereof."	Leonardo da Vinci	Leonardo's Notebooks	2019-01-02 04:37:13.547942
1864	"The task of a philosophy of photography is to reflect upon this possibility of freedom - and thus its significance - in a world dominated by apparatuses; to reflect upon the way in which, despite everything, it is possible for human beings to give significance to their lives in the face of the chance necessity of death. Such a philosophy is necessary because it is the only form of revolution left open to us."	VilÃ©m Flusser	Towards a Philosophy of Photography	2019-01-02 04:37:13.810397
1865	"We don't need more museums that try to construct the historical narratives of a society, community, team, nation, state, tribe, company, or species.

1866	"I say that good painters imitated nature; but that bad ones vomited it."	Miguel De Cervantes (Author)	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:14.327997
1867	"A cultured society that has fallen away from its religious traditions expects more from art than the aesthetic consciousness and the 'standpoint of art' can deliver. The Romantic desire for a new mythology... gives the artist and his task in the world the consciousness of a new consecration. He is something like a 'secular saviour' for his creations are expected to achieve on a small scale the propitiation of disaster for which an unsaved world hopes."	Hans-Georg Gadamer	Truth and Method	2019-01-02 04:37:14.588551
1868	"If there is on earth, and among all these things of nothing, a belief worthy of adoration, if there is anything holy, pure and sublime, anything answering that immoderate desire for the infinite and the vague that we call the soul, it is art."	Gustave Flaubert	Memoirs of a Madman	2019-01-02 04:37:14.861198
1870	"I feel like I'm in a film about a struggling artist who keeps getting up at all hours of the night to look at his big, blank empty canvas. And in a way I am. Except that i'm not struggling. I'm Hector Kipling. I might be getting up at all hours of the night to look at my big, blank, empty canvas, but I am not fucking struggling."	David Thewlis	The Late Hector Kipling	2019-01-02 04:37:15.38105

1875	"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself."	Oscar Wilde	The Picture of Dorian Gray	2019-01-02 04:37:18.682593
1876	"I know the empathy borne of despair; I know the fluidity of thought, the expansive, even beautiful, mind that hypomania brings, and I know this is quicksilver and precious and often it's poison. There has always existed a sort of psychic butcher who works the scales of transcendence, who weighs out the bloody cost of true art."	David Lovelace	Scattershot: My Bipolar Family	2019-01-02 04:37:18.939959

1884	"Drawing is what you see of the world, truly see...And sometimes what you see is so deep in your head you're not even sure of what you're seeing. But when it's down there on paper, and you look at it, really look, you'll see the way things are...that's the world, isn't it? You have to keep looking to find the truth."

1886	"How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it."	Albert Einstein	The World as I See It	2019-01-02 04:37:21.559338

1892	"I think the mystery of art lies in this, that artistsâ relationship is essentially with their work â not with power, not with profit, not with themselves, not even with their audience."	Ursula K. Le Guin	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:23.136369
1894	"I made art a philosophy, and philosophy an art: I altered the minds of men, and the colour of things: I awoke the imagination of my century so that it created myth and legend around me: I summed up all things in a phrase, all existence in an epigram: whatever I touched I made beautiful"	Oscar Wilde	De Profundis and Other Writings	2019-01-02 04:37:23.654095

1900	"Of course they won't bloody remember, they'll be dead.' Then she called him a name in a dead language that translated, roughly, to 'poop on a stick,' but sounded more succinct, like this: 'Of course they won't bloody remember, they'll be dead, Poopstick."	Christopher Moore	SacrÃ© Bleu: A Comedy d'Art	2019-01-02 04:37:25.223496
1902	"...[F]ireworks had for her a direct and magical appeal. Their attraction was more complex than that of any other form of art. They had pattern and sequence, colour and sound, brilliance and mobility; they had suspense, surprise, and a faint hint of danger; above all, they had the supreme quality of transience, which puts the keenest edge on beauty and makes it touch some spring in the heart which more enduring excellences cannot reach."	Jan Struther	Mrs. Miniver	2019-01-02 04:37:25.740102
1903	"That is an artist as I love artists, modest in his needs: he really wants only two things, his bread and his art - panem et Circen."	Friedrich Nietzsche	Twilight of the Idols	2019-01-02 04:37:26.000904
1904	"I do an awful lot of thinking and dreaming about things in the past and the future - the timelessness of the rocks and the hills - all the people who have existed there. I prefer winter and fall, when you feel the bone structure of the landscape - the loneliness of it, the dead feeling of winter. Something waits beneath it, the whole story doesn't show."	Andrew Wyeth	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:28.109787
1906	"Good art wounds as well as delights. It must, because our defenses against the truth are wound so tightly around us. But as art chips away at our defenses, it also opens us to healing potentialities that transcend intellectual games and ego-preserving strategies."	Rollo May	My Quest for Beauty	2019-01-02 04:37:28.636963

1909	"What has our culture lost in 1980 that the avant-garde had in 1890? Ebullience, idealism, confidence, the belief that there was plenty of territory to explore, and above all the sense that art, in the most disinterested and noble way, could find the necessary metaphors by which a radically changing culture could be explained to its inhabitants."	Robert Hughes	The Shock of the New	2019-01-02 04:37:29.420507
1910	"A piece of art comes to life, when we can feel, it is breathing, when it talks to us and starts raising questions. It may dispel biased perceptions; make us recognize ignored fragments and remember forsaken episodes of our life story. Art may sometimes even be nasty and disturbing, if we donât want to consent to its philosophy or concept, but it might, in the end, perhaps reconcile us with ourselves. ("When is Art?")"	Erik Pevernagie	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:29.685436

1915	"If you participate in life, you donât see it clearly: you suffer from it too much or enjoy it too much. The artist, to my way of thinking, is a monstrosity, something outside nature. All the misfortunes Providence inflicts on him come from his stubborness in denying that maxim."	Gustave Flaubert	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:30.985897
1916	"On the whole, lying is a cheerful affair. Embellishments are intended to give pleasure. People long to tell you what they imagine you want to hear. They want to amuse you; they want to amuse themselves; they want to show you a good time. This is beyond hospitality. This is art."

1921	"Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience, a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle...The encounter with the truth of art happens in the estranging language and images which make perceptible, visible, and audible that which is no longer, or not yet, perceived, said, and heard in everyday life."

1931	"Poetry isnât an island, it is the bridge.  Poetry isnât a ship, it is the lifeboat.  Poetry isnât swimming. Poetry is water."	Kamand Kojouri	\N	2019-01-02 04:37:35.233177
1933	"There is truth in stories. There is truth in one of your paintings, boy, or in a sunset or a couplet from Homer. Fiction is truth, even if it is not fact. If you believe only facts and forget stories, your brain will live, but your heart will die."	Cassandra Clare	Lord of Shadows	2019-01-02 04:37:35.763637
1934	"Mastering the art of seduction gives one a great power, and like any power, it's to be wielded with responsibility; a man who wields the art of seduction without a sense of responsibility and restraint is a walking proximity bomb of viral epidemics, needless procreation, heartbroken families, and shattered dreams."

1941	"Our vanity, our passions, our spirit of imitation, our abstract intelligence, our habits have long been at work, and it is the task of art to undo this work of theirs, making us travel back in the direction from which we have come to the depths where what has really existed lies unknown within us."

1958	"I have treated many artists. There are among them many neurotics, so many that one finally comes to believe that one cannot be an artist without being neurotic. Again I found in them that inner conflict which is characteristic of modern man: the conflict between a right intuition (namely, that their vocation has fundamental importance for the destiny of humanity) and a false idea (namely, that art is superfluous luxury)."	Paul Tournier	The Whole Person in a Broken World	2019-01-02 04:37:44.631576
1962	"For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us."

2045	"Good composition is like a suspension bridge; each line adds strength and takes none away... Making lines run into each other is not composition. There must be motive for the connection.

2001	"That's because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear - the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness."

2003	"I do not know anything about Art with a capital A. What I do know about is my art. Because it concerns me. I do not speak for others.

2004	"Well, Daddy, I used to believe that artists went crazy in the process of creating the beautiful works of art that kept society sane.

Claes Oldenburg	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:05.198574
2020	"We can never be entirely original, as artists or as people. The genius and vision of those who came before us is too great for us to digress from entirely.

Do you ever look at the people in the street? Aren't you afraid of them? I am. They move past you and they wear hats and they carry bundles. But that's not the substance of them. The substance of them is hatred for any man who loves his work. That's the only kind they fear. I don't know why"	Ayn Rand	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:15.458405
2053	"All art is abstract, because art is an abstraction of the truth."	Milford Zornes	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:16.229908
2054	"It's up to the artist to use language that can be understood, not hide it in some private code. Most of these jokers don't even want to use language you and I know or can learn . . . they would rather sneer at us and be smug, because we 'fail' to see what they are driving at. If indeed they are driving at anything--obscurity is usually the refuge of incompetence."	Robert A. Heinlein	Stranger in a Strange Land	2019-01-02 04:38:18.489043
2055	"Dreams are what guide us, art is what defines us, math is what makes it all possible, and love is what lights our way."	Mike  Norton	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:18.746757

2057	"Iâve always seen this in you, ever since you were a little girl â this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and itâs what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you."

2065	"When you want to make the main color pure and bright, don't just keep adding bright colors on it. Just make the colors around the spot darker and dull. It will give the scene dramatical effects.  I think the life is the same."	Hiroko Sakai	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:21.343661
2197	"The hare of history once more overtakes the tortoise of art."	Kurt Vonnegut	Mother Night	2019-01-02 04:39:03.886325
2067	"A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between her work and her play; her labor and her leisure; her mind and her body; her education and her recreation. She hardly knows which is which. She simply pursues her vision of excellence through whatever she is doing, and leaves others to determine if she is working or playing. To herself, she always appears to be doing both."	Francois Rene De Chateaubriand	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:21.859755

2074	"I love to drawâpencil, ink penâI love art. When I go on tour and visit museums in Holland, Germany or Englandâyou know those huge paintings?âIâm just amazed. You donât think a painter could do something like that. I can look at a piece of sculpture or a painting and totally lose myself in it."	Michael  Jackson	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:23.668556
2075	"A face that has the marks of having lived intensely, that expresses some phase of life, some dominant quality or intellectual power, constitutes for me an interesting face. For this reason the face of an older person, perhaps not beautiful in the strictest sense, is usually more appealing than the face of a younger person who has scarcely been touched by life."	Doris Ulmann	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:23.927498

2085	"Humans had built a world inside the world, which reflected it in pretty much the same way as a drop of water reflected the landscape. And yet ... and yet ...  Inside this little world they had taken pains to put all the things you might think they would want to escape from â hatred, fear, tyranny, and so forth. Death was intrigued. They thought they wanted to be taken out of themselves, and every art humans dreamt up took them further	Terry Pratchett	Wyrd Sisters	2019-01-02 04:38:28.663832
2086	"The cruelest thing you can do to an artist is tell them their work is flawless when it isn't"	Yahtzee Croshaw	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:28.924428

2090	"The elegance is as physical, as moral quality that has nothing common with the clothing. You can see a countrywoman more elegant than one so called elegant woman."	Karl Lagerfeld	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:29.96044
2091	"Modern romance, like Greek tragedy, celebrates the mystery of dismemberment, which is life in time. The happy ending is justly scorned as a misrepresentation; for the world, as we know it, as we have seen it, yields but one ending: death, disintegration, dismemberment, and the crucifixion of our heart with the passing of the forms that we have loved."	Joseph Campbell	The Hero With a Thousand Faces	2019-01-02 04:38:30.218036
2092	"It's a very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is. I think it's healthy that people should have this experience."	Aldous Huxley	Moksha: Writings on Psychedelics & the Visionary Experience	2019-01-02 04:38:30.476137
2093	"Color is all. When color is right, form is right. Color is everything, color is vibration like music; everything is vibration."	Marc Chagall	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:30.730584
2094	"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man âwhoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation."	Plato	The Republic	2019-01-02 04:38:30.986131
2097	"You know a trillion times more about art than me. But Iâve learned that it isnât necessary to know all that much. You just make what you wanna see, right? Itâs a game, right? Itâs like being paid for dreaming."	Tom Robbins	Skinny Legs and All	2019-01-02 04:38:31.77815

2099	"He thought of trying to explain something he had recently noticed about himself: that if anyone insulted him, or one of his friends, he didn't really mind--or not much, anyway. Whereas if anyone insulted a novel, a story, a poem that he loved, something visceral and volcanic occurred within him. He wasn't sure what this might mean--except perhaps that he had got life and art mixed up, back to front, upside down."	Julian Barnes	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:32.291097
2101	"You cannot create a piece of art merely for money. Doing it as part of commerce so denudes art of wonder that it ceases to be art."	Seth Godin	Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?	2019-01-02 04:38:32.844965

2108	"Your paintings are staggeringly beautiful. Did I ever tell you that,or was I just too concerned that you weren't going to earn a living? I know the answer...I worried that the paint was so thickly applied that it might snap off and ruin someone's carpet, rather than realizing that you'd made color itself tactile."	Rosamund Lupton	Sister	2019-01-02 04:38:34.672047

2114	"A picture lives by companionship, expanding and quickening in the eyes of the sensitive observer. It dies by the same token. It is therefore risky to send it out into the world. How often it must be impaired by the eyes of the unfeeling and the cruelty of the impotent."	Mark Rothko	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:38.143437
2115	"The mask of art is the means through which corruption is spread. The mask makes vice seem beautiful, turns squalor and nastiness into glamorous thrill, seduces the onlooker into the game â and leaves him or her with the corpse on his hands."	Jennifer Birkett	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:38.400277
2116	"The poets are supposed to liberate the words â not chain them in phrases. Who told the poets they were supposed to think? Poets are meant to sing and to make words sing. Writers don't own their words. Since when do words belong to anybody? 'Your very own words,' indeed! And who are you?"	Brion Gysin 	Brion Gysin Let the Mice In	2019-01-02 04:38:38.665497
2118	"Both those taking snaps and documentary photographers, however, have not understood 'information.'

2120	"The best thing to do is to loosen my grip on my pen and let it go wandering about until it finds an entrance. There must be one â everything depends on the circumstances, a rule applicable as much to literary style as to life. Each word tugs another one along, one idea another, and that is how books, governments and revolutions are made â some even say that is how Nature created her species."	Machado de Assis	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:39.716135
2121	"An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an originals motivated be necessity. It is marvelous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms. To create is divine, to reproduce is human."	Man Ray	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:39.982047
2146	"I know that this process of âme changing my lifeâ doesnât just end once I set fire to this list of things I hate about myself.

2123	"There is neither a proportional relationship, nor an inverse one, between a writerâs estimation of a work in progress & its actual quality. The feeling that the work is magnificent, & the feeling that it is abominable, are both mosquitoes to be repelled, ignored, or killed, but not indulged."	Annie Dillard	The Writing Life	2019-01-02 04:38:40.513807
2124	"The work of art is a stuffed crocodile."	Alfred Jarry	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:40.775285
2125	"My art is an attempt to reach beyond the surface appearance. I want to see growth in wood, time in stone, nature in a city, and I do not mean its parks but a deeper understanding that a city is nature too-the ground upon which it is built, the stone with which it is made."	Andy Goldsworthy	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:41.037878
2126	"In eleven or twelve years of writing, Mike, I can lay claim to at least this: I have never written beneath myself. I have never written anything that I didn't want my name attached to. I have probed deeper in some scripts and I've been more successful in some than others. But all of them that have been on, you know, I'll take my lick. They're mine and that's the way I wanted them."	Rod Serling	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:41.303355
2127	"The best literature is always a take [in the musical sense]; there is an implicit risk in its execution, a margin of danger that is the pleasure of the flight, of the love, carrying with it a tangible loss but also a total engagement that, on another level, lends the theater its unparalleled imperfection faced with the perfection of film.  I donât want to write anything but takes."	Julio CortÃ¡zar	Around the Day in Eighty Worlds	2019-01-02 04:38:41.561442

2129	"Technology adds nothing to art. Two thousand years ago, I could tell you a story, and at any point during the story I could stop, and ask, Now do you want the hero to be kidnapped, or not? But that would, of course, have ruined the story. Part of the experience of being entertained is sitting back and plugging into someone else's vision."	Penn Jillette	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:42.102015

2136	"I think women dwell quite a bit on the duress under which they work, on how hard it is just to do it at all. We are traditionally rather proud of ourselves for having slipped creative work in there between the domestic chores and obligations. I'm not sure we deserve such big A-pluses for all that."

2145	"The one thing you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can. The moment that you feel that just possibly you are walking down the street nakedâ¦thatâs the moment you may be starting to get it right."	Neil Gaiman	Make Good Art	2019-01-02 04:38:48.380769
2149	"To become truly immortal, a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken, it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams."	Giorgio de Chirico	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:49.418423

2162	"In my early work, I tried to hide my personality, my psychological state, my emotions. This was partly due to my feelings about myself and party due to my feelings about painting at the time.

2168	"All works of nonfiction, or memoir, have to first and foremost be art before they can be true. They have to be artful first before they can be truthful... If you emphasize the truth-telling at the expense of art, nobody is going to be interested in it. And if you sacrifice truth in the name of art, you risk triviality. There's a constant balance between those two."	Alan Shapiro	\N	2019-01-02 04:38:54.552634
2169	"It starts off like climbing a tree or solving a puzzle - poetry, if nothing else, is just fun to write. But deeper into each and every piece, you no longer hesitate to call it work. It's passion. A poet's sense of lyrical accomplishment is then his food and water, his means of survival."	Criss Jami	Killosophy	2019-01-02 04:38:54.810572
2199	"The scientist seeks laws; the historian, causes; the artist, freedom."	Marty Rubin	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:04.40675

2192	"Once upon a time there were mass media, and they were wicked, of course, and there was a guilty party. Then there were the virtuous voices that accused the criminals. And Art (ah, what luck!) offered alternatives, for those who were not prisoners to the mass media.  Well, it's all over. We have to start again from the beginning, asking one another what's going on."	Umberto Eco	Travels in Hyperreality	2019-01-02 04:39:02.586319

2200	"Wonderful art can spring from misery,I'm the last person to deny that.I'd go even further:the best works of art of all time are probably stemmed from the deep human sorrow or hellish frustration,the death of a loved one or a divorce and yes:jealousy.Heartache and impotence as the man-spring for making the unverifiable verifiable and for giving it face.How romantic,beautiful and especially useful pain and misery can be."

2211	"If thereâs a thing, a scene, maybe, an image that you want to see real bad, that you need to see but it doesnât exist in the world around you, at least not in the form that you envision, then you create it so that you can look at it and have it around, or show it to other people who wouldnât have imagined it because they perceive reality in a more narrow, predictable way. And thatâs it. Thatâs all an artist does."	Tom Robbins	Skinny Legs and All	2019-01-02 04:39:09.854632

2215	"Is being burnt a requisite for the making of art? Personally, I don't think it is. But art is poultice for a burn. It is a privilege to have, somewhere within you, a capacity for making something speak from your own seared experience."

2226	"There is something about the act of studying an unclothed body, as an artist does, that allows a person to appreciate it as pure form, regardless of the kinds of traits traditionally regarded as imperfections. In a figure drawing class, an obese woman's folds of flesh take on a kind of beauty. You can look at a man's shrunken chest or legs or buttocks with tenderness. Age is not ugly, just poignant."	Joyce Maynard	The Good Daughters	2019-01-02 04:39:13.779178

2229	"Life itself has lost its plane reality: it is projected, not along the old fixed points, but along the dynamic coordinates of Einstein, of revolution. In this new projection, the best-known formulas and objects become displaced, fantastic, familiar-unfamiliar. This is why it is so logical for literature today to be drawn to the fantastic plot, or to the amalgam of reality and fantasy.

2232	"In the moment before I crossed over, I knew that the priests and magicians of Egypt were fools and charlatans for promising to prolong the beauties of life beyond the world we are give. Death is no enemy, but the foundation of gratitude, sympathy, and art. All of life's pleasures, only love owes no debt to death."	Anita Diamant	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:15.347632

2238	"I do strongly feel that among the greatest pieces of luck for high achievement is ordeal. Certain great artists can make out without it, Titian and others, but mostly you need ordeal. My idea is this: the artist is extremely lucky who is presented with the worst possible ordeal which will not actually kill him. At that point, he's in business: Beethoven's deafness, Goya's deafness, Milton's blindness, that kind of thing."	John Berryman	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:18.579836
2239	"What keeps earth air breathable? Not oxygen alone.

2253	"The truth is, anyone who puts so much of herself and her life into art as you do must naturally fear any failure in that art as a potential threat to your life. And so you protect your art more than you protect your health or the common forms of happiness the rest of us have. And you probably have this in common with every artist you admire."

2272	"All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music. For while in all other kinds of art it is possible to distinguish the matter from the form, and the understanding can always make this distinction, yet it is the constant effort of art to obliterate it."	Walter Pater	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:29.244234

2282	"A corollary of this has been that Christians have thought that they should only create art with a Pollyanna quality to it: paintings of birds and kittens, movies that extol family life and end happily, songs that are positive and uplifting â in short, works of art that show a world that is almost unfallen where no one experiences conflict and where sin is naughty rather than wicked."

2298	"Our mind is the canvas on which the artists lay their colour; their pigments are our emotions; their chiaroscuro the light of joy, the shadow of sadness. The masterpiece is of ourselves, as we are of the masterpiece."	KakuzÅ Okakura	The Book of Tea	2019-01-02 04:39:37.921742
2299	"I could watch him do this until morning â never asking questions and never interrupting his work.

2320	"Lines are results, do not draw them for themselves. ... Lines give birth to lines. Drawing is not following a line on the model, it is drawing your sense of the thing. ... Make a drawing flow, stopping sometimes, and going on. ... Search for the simple constructive forces, line the lines of a suspension bridge. Get the few main lines and see what lines they call out. ... Have purpose in the places where lines stop."	Robert Henri	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:43.654089

2324	"...itâs just another one of those things I donât understand: everyone impresses upon you how unique you are, encouraging you to cultivate your individuality while at the same time trying to squish you and everyone else into the same ridiculous mould.

2345	"Whether you dance, draw, make music, shoot field goals, build houses, tune engines, or sit around all day watching television, you are an artist. Your single greatest work of art is your self. As with any art form, the more you understand and develop your talents, the more empowered and masterful you become as an artist. This is particularly important when engaging in the art of consciously shaping your own life."	Scott Edmund Miller	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:52.531614

2347	"Art in relation to life is nothing more than a glove turned inside out. It seems to have the same shapes and contours, but it can never be used for the same purpose. Art teaches nothing about life, just as life teaches us nothing about art."	Morton Feldman	Give My Regards to Eighth Street: Collected Writings	2019-01-02 04:39:53.200047

2355	"Photography is like stealing.You rob someone of a moment that exposes something essential about their character,their soul if you like.there are people who are very conscious of that,who find that terrifying.The thought that everyone,friend of foe,can get so close to you,look you straight in the eye and judge you without having any control over it or being able to respond.A part of them has become the property of the photographer."	Esther Verhoef	Close-up	2019-01-02 04:39:57.162341

2361	"Art is an act of the soul, not the intellect. When we are dealing with people's dreams - their visions, really - we are in the realm of the sacred. We are involved with forces and energies larger than our own. We are engaged in a sacred transaction of which we know only a little: the shadow, not the shape."	Julia Cameron	\N	2019-01-02 04:39:58.735287
2362	"Pornography wonât be enough. Because it never is. Sooner or later, all niggers want to touch the real thing. All dogs want to smell and taste the true information.

2363	"A comparably capacious embrace of beauty and pleasure - an embrace that somehow extends to death as well as life, to dissolution as well as creation - characterizes Montaigne's restless reflections on matter in motion, Cervantes's chronicle of his mad knight, Michelangelo's depiction of flayed skin, Leonardo's sketches of whirlpools, Caravaggio's loving attention to the dirty soles of Christ's feet."

2366	"On the opposite wall was a Damien Hirst spot painting, bought by Arabella after a decent bonus season. Roger's considered view of the painting, looking at it from aesthetic, art-historical, interior-design, and psychological points of view, was that it had cost forty-seven thousand pounds, plus VAT."

2368	"To devote yourself to the creation and enjoyment of beauty, then, can be a serious businessânot always necessarily a means of escaping reality, but sometimes a means of holding on to the real when everything is flaking away intoâ¦ rhetoric and plot."	Elizabeth Gilbert	Eat, Pray, Love	2019-01-02 04:40:00.593912
2369	"I believe the visionaries and true reflections of society will be rewarded after their lives. Those being rewarded now are giving the public what it needs now, usually applauding its current state and clearing consciences."	Hollace M. Metzger	\N	2019-01-02 04:40:00.851208
2370	"True art is thoughtful, emotional examination of how human themes impact the overall experience of existing. The rest is kitsch."	Tiffany Madison	\N	2019-01-02 04:40:01.108928

2376	"There was the honour and austerity of money as he walked through art galleries, as he saw around him the collections of oil paintings by dead men, lit so carefully that warmth seemed to emanate from within - and not because their art was loved or understood but because it could be sold and bought for handsome sums."

2382	"True freedom only exists in art.The problem is you have to be incredibly good.No,I am putting it wrong:You don't so much have to be outstanding,what you really need are connections,if you don't want to be dependent on all kinds of government foundations who will impose their ideas and restrictions on you in turn.It can be touch and go in the beginning:It takes guts to let go of everything.But you make it,you're free."

2392	"It is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,âa thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form."	Ralph Waldo Emerson	Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson	2019-01-02 04:40:09.47481

2398	"Gormenghast.  Withdrawn and ruinous it broods in umbra: the immemorial masonry: the towers, the tracts. Is all corroding? No. Through an avenue of spires a zephyr floats; a bird whistles; a freshet beats away from a choked river. Deep in a fist of stone a doll's hand wriggles, warm rebellious on the frozen palm. A shadow shifts its length. A spider stirs...  And darkness winds between the characters. - Gormenghast"	Mervyn Peake	\N	2019-01-02 04:40:11.050571
2399	"The verb 'to darn' is explained in my pocket dictionary as follows: 'To mend by imitating the texture of the stuff, with thread and needle.' But this definition does not correspond to the work accomplished by good Chinese housewives. When they mend a sock, they do not try 'to imitate the texture of the stuff'. Their art makes no attempt at concealment: it even takes a certain pride in revealing itself."	Daniele VarÃ¨	The Maker of Heavenly Trousers	2019-01-02 04:40:11.312301
2400	"Keep music and art alive in our schools because the greatness of a country is not measured by wars that are won, by territory annexed or even the size of a deficit. It is measured by the beauty of the art work by talented hands, the sounds of the music created from the heart and by the wonder of the eyes and ears beholding them in joy. Art and music are the windows of the soul of any country. The greater the art created, the greater the country."	Clarrissa Lee Moon	\N	2019-01-02 04:40:11.592349

2403	"A hundred francs! Oh, dear me! It is worth millions of francs, my child. But my -- dealer -- here tells me that in fact a picture is worth only what someone will give for it. How much money do you have?" Julia took out her purse and counted. "Four francs and twenty sous," she said, looking up at him sadly. "Is that all the money you have in the world?" She nodded.

2404	"The darkness behind my closed eyelids was like the cloud-covered sky, but the gray was somewhat deeper. Every few minutes, someone would come and paint over the gray with a different-textured gray - one with a touch of gold or green or red. I was impressed with the variety of grays that existed. Human beings were so strange. All you had to do was sit still for ten minutes, and you could see this amazing variety of grays."	Haruki Murakami	The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle	2019-01-02 04:40:12.644403

2413	"A work of art wastes away and becomes lustreless in surroundings where it has a price but not a value. It radiates only when surrounded by love.

2414	"It is hard to think of any work of art of which one can say 'this saved the life of one Jew, one Vietnamese, one Cambodian'. Specific books, perhaps; but as far as one can tell, no paintings or sculptures. The difference between us and the artists of the 1920's is that they they thought such a work of art could be made.

2420	"At last everything was satisfactorily arranged, and I could not help admiring the setting: these mingled touches betrayed on a small scale the inspiration of a poet, the research of a scientist, the good taste of an artist, the gourmetâs fondness for good food, and the love of flowers, which concealed in their delicate shadows a hint of the love of women"	August Strindberg	Madman's Defence	2019-01-02 04:40:19.033509

2425	"Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on to other things.

To produce is of little use unless what we produce is known, is widely known, the wider known the better, for it is by being known that it works, it influences, it does its duty, it does good. We must try, then, to be known, aim at it, take means to it. And this without puffing in the process or pride in the success."

2546	"The true artist plays mad with his soul, labors at the very lip of the volcano, but remembers and clings to his purpose, which is as strong as the dream. He is not someone possessed, like Cassandra, but a passionate, easily tempted explorer who fully intends to get home again, like Odysseus."	John Gardner	\N	2019-01-02 04:41:01.94504

2550	"(The Mona Lisa), that really is the ugliest portrait Iâve seen, the only thing that supposedly makes it famous is the mystery behind it,â Katherine admitted as she remembered her trips to the Louvre and how she shook her head at the poor tourists crowding around to see a jaundiced, eyebrow-less lady that reminded her of tight-lipped Washington on the dollar bill. Surely, they could have chosen a better portrait of the First President for their currency?"	E.A. Bucchianeri	Brushstrokes of a Gadfly,	2019-01-02 04:41:03.015715
2551	"[Picasso] loved...women for the sexual, carnivorous impulses they aroused in him. Mixing blood and sperm, he exalted women in his paintings, imposed his violence on them, and sentenced them to death once he felt their mystery had been discharged and the sexual power they instilled in him had dulled...

2553	"Carrie felt this as a personal reproof. She read "Dora Thorne," or had a great deal in the past. It seemed only fair to her, but she supposed that people thought it very fine. Now this clear- eyed, fine-headed youth, who looked something like a student to her, made fun of it. It was poor to him, not worth reading. She looked down, and for the first time felt the pain of not understanding."	Theodore Dreiser	Sister Carrie	2019-01-02 04:41:03.816747
2555	"Admittedly, art is somewhat like spit. It does not repulse or even worry is while it is still inside of us, but once it exits our body, it becomes disgusting."	Ivan Brunetti	\N	2019-01-02 04:41:04.333352
2556	"This highest kind of truth is never something the artist takes as given. It's not his point of departure but his goal. Though the artist has beliefs, like other people, he realizes that a salient characteristic of art is its radical openness to persuasion. Even those beliefs he's surest of, the artist puts under pressure to see if they will stand."	John Gardner	The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers	2019-01-02 04:41:04.590381

2585	"The painted aircraft took on sunlight and pulse. Sweeps of color, bands and spatters, airy washes, the force of saturated lightâthe whole thing oddly personal, a sense of one painterâs hand moved by impulse and afterthought as much as by epic design. I hadnât expected to register such pleasure and sensation. The air was color-scrubbed, coppers and ochers burning off the metal skin of the aircraft to exchange with the framing desert."

Even when itâs perfect.â Millie drew a deep breath as if she remembered how perfect it had truly been. âThe most intimate thing we can do is to allow the people we love most to see us at our worst.

2611	"If you live today, you breath in nihilism ... it's the gas you breathe. If I hadn't had the Church to fight it with or to tell me the necessity of fighting it, I would be the stinkingest logical positivist you ever saw right now."	Flannery O'Connor	\N	2019-01-02 05:03:50.314163
2612	"I sat on the bed. I looked at the Rorschach blot. I tried to make it look like a spreading tree, shadows pooled beneath it, but it didn't. It looked more like a dead cat I once found, the fat, glistening grubs writhing blindly, squirming over each other, frantically tunneling away from the light. But even that isn't the real horror. The horror is this: in the end, it is simply a picture of empty meaningless blackness."	Alan Moore	Watchmen	2019-01-02 05:03:50.570758

Friedrich Nietzsche	The Will to Power	2019-01-02 05:03:50.840937
2616	"We have created a manic world nauseous with the pursuit of material wealth. Many also bear their cross of imagined deprivation, while their fellow human beings remain paralyzed by real poverty. We drown in the thick sweetness of our sensual excess, and our shameless opulence, while our discontent souls suffocate in the arid wasteland of spiritual deprivation."	Anthon St. Maarten	\N	2019-01-02 05:03:51.647388
2618	"We are living in the era of premeditation and the perfect crime. Our criminals are no longer helpless children who could plead love as their excuse.

2633	"He was simply someone who floated through our lives and didn't seem to care how flatly he perceived everyone or that he'd shared our secret failures with the world, showcasing the youthful indifference, the gleaming nihilism, glamorizing the horror of it all."

2636	"The priest therefore saw what the anchorite could not. That God needs no witness. Neither to himself nor against. The truth is rather that if there were no God then there could be no witness for there could be no identity to the world but only each man's opinion of it. The priest saw that there is no man who is elect because there is no man who is not. To God every man is a heretic."	Cormac McCarthy	\N	2019-01-02 05:03:59.227226
2637	"Despite its successes, in the end, philosophical thinking always falls short of its real goal. It involves both the wonder of aspiring toward the Truth and the distress of falling short of that Truth. In this way, philosophy can be characterized as wondrous distress."	John Marmysz	The Path of Philosophy: Truth, Wonder, and Distress	2019-01-02 05:03:59.484816

2644	"Iâve always been suspicious of the assumption that great intelligence would be an unqualified benefitâ that the madness that so often accompanies it can be cavalierly dismissed. So I asked the question: Suppose there were an entire subpopulation of extreme geniuses, well beyond anything that would occur naturally. What would that really look like?"	Andrew M.

2647	"â¦ the major enemy of black survival in America has been and is neither oppression nor exploitation but rather the nihilistic threatâthat is, loss of hope and absence of meaning. For as long as hope remains and meaning is preserved, the possibility of overcoming oppression stays alive. The self-fulfilling prophecy of the nihilistic threat is that without hope there can be no future, that without meaning there can be no struggle."	Cornel West	Race Matters	2019-01-02 05:04:02.152458
2648	"You have to take an interest in something in life, I told myself. I wondered what could interest me, now that I was finished with love. I could take a course in wine tasting, maybe, or start collecting model aeroplanes."	Michel Houellebecq	Soumission	2019-01-02 05:04:02.411184

2658	"Bruno withdrew from the field of history more resolutely than Vigo; that is why I prefer the formerâs retrospect but the latterâs prospect. As an anarch, I am determined to go along with nothing, ultimately take nothing seriously â at least not nihilistically, but rather as a border guard in no manâs land, who sharpens his eyes and ears between the tides."

2661	"Whereas a belief in an absurd world arises out of the fundamental disharmony of a person searching for meaning in an apparently meaninglessness universe, an existential nihilist displays impassive intellectual stoicism towards their eventual mortality while embracing a passionate artistic commitment to munity against the underlying syndrome of insignificance and confusion encasing life."

2665	"Our planet is a freak which we shall destroy by our own wicked senseless activities in the next century. Our history will very soon come to an end. Now that God is dead, we are at last presented with the truth, yes, the truth remains, but it is on a short lead. Anyway, we are nothing and it matters not what we do."	Iris Murdoch	The Green Knight	2019-01-02 05:04:08.742419

2667	"Nihilism brings us down to earth by forcing us to confront our puniness, our failures and our finitude. It reminds us that we are not gods, and thus helps to put us back into our appropriate place."	John Marmysz	Cinematic Nihilism: Encounters, Confrontations, Overcomings	2019-01-02 05:04:09.413494

2669	"No! No! I refuse to believe it. I'm sure you've often wished there was an after-life.'  Of course I had, I told him. Everybody has that wish at times. But that had no more importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or have a better-shaped mouth."	Albert Camus	The Stranger	2019-01-02 05:04:09.929015

2673	"It wasn't only the boosted experiences that bothered Rant. It was dipshit kids done up as soldiers and princesses and witches. Eating cake flavored with artificial vanilla. Celebrating a harvest that didn't occur anymore. Fruit punch that came from a factory. A ritual to placate ghosts, or whatever bullshit Halloween does, practiced by people who had no awareness of that. What bothered Rant was the fake, bullshit nature of everything."	Chuck Palahniuk (author)	\N	2019-01-02 05:04:10.977032
2675	"I might have been vaguely inclined to dismiss the stone angel as meaningless, and to go from there to the meaninglessness of all. But after I saw what Krebbs had done, in particular what he had done to my sweet cat, nihilism was not for me. Somebody or something did not wish me to be a nihilist."

2694	"Both Bratva and thieves in law would like to call themselves nihilists and anarchists because they donât support the established government, but they govern nonetheless, and you canât be an anarchist unless you follow its rule. Crime and anarchy are no more synonymous than nihilism and existentialism, or fatalism and determinism; so many isms there was bound to be a schism."	Tanya Thompson	Red Russia	2019-01-02 05:04:18.279118

2696	"My consultants recommended several nihilists and existentialists but I rejected them all. A black turtleneck sweater does not a misanthrope make. Nihilists and existentialists tend to be bohemians, who invariably run in packs; despite their alienated stance, they have always struck me as a sociable lot who surround themselves with people because they are forever saying "Nothing matters," and they need someone to say it to."

2698	"Like alcoholism and drug addiction, nihilism is a disease of the soul. It can never be completely cured, and there is always the possibility of relapse. But there is always a chance for conversion -- a chance for people to believe that there is hope for the future and a meaning to struggle... Nihilism is not overcome by arguments or analyses; it is tamed by love and care."	Cornel West	Race Matters	2019-01-02 05:04:19.314774
2699	"I didnât belong to myself anymore. I had no mouth or eyes or thoughts. I didnât need anything to change or be different...

2700	"He thinks and speaks with a ruthlessness that makes no attempt to find dialectical excuses for the eternal uncertainty of humankind. Anyone who claims that truth is dependent on usefulness, anyone who openly admits that knowing and believing are essentially the same for limited beings such as humans, is clearly a nihilist in a class of his own."

2707	"So, I found my refuge in art. I could find no truth in art, but I was obsessed with the beauty of its lies. The world was full of shit in all the wrong ways, but in art I could find whatever line of bullshit most satisfied me. And unlike religion, it didnât require the gullibility to actually fall for it, only the ability to entertain it, and to be entertained by it."	T.J. Kirk	\N	2019-01-02 05:04:21.681685

2710	"Well, I maintain that we haven't one single Russian Socialist; there are none and there have never been, for all our Socialists are also landowners or divinity students.

2713	"The man who exulted under torture, who hurled curses at God and beauty, who hardened himself in the harsh atmosphere of crime, now only wants to marry someone "with a future." The mage, the seer, the convict who lived perpetually in the shadow of the penal colony, the man-king on a godless earth, always carried seventeen pounds of gold in a belt worn uncomfortably round his stomach, which he complained gave him dysentery."

2734	"A rejection of absolutism, in all its forms, may sometimes slip into moral relativism or even nihilism, an erosion of values that hold society together, but for most of our history it has encouraged the very process of information gathering, analysis, argument, and persuasion which allows us to make better, if not perfect, choices â not only about the means to our ends, but also the ends themselves."

Though that emotion is ever changing as flowing water changes, it at least bears us along on a current that gives the illusion of continuity and permanence.

2790	"I think the suicide rate is so high among writers because we force ourselves to stand still, take an outsiderâs perspective, and realise how quickly a life passes by, and how futile we are. The exhilarating upside is that at a momentâs glance all your worries fade away, and you can work on making the most of it."	Kevin Focke	\N	2019-01-02 05:04:49.557579

2806	"Nietzsche says very clearly all the way through his career that if you want to define human nature the first thing you must say is that human beings insist on value--we see the world through value colored eyes.

Jean-Paul Sartre	Existentialism Is a Humanism	2019-01-02 05:10:12.255834

2937	"I wonder if being sane means disregarding the chaos that is life, pretending only an infinitesimal segment of it is reality."	Rabih Alameddine	Koolaids: The Art of War	2019-01-02 05:10:12.7836
2938	"Some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. "I think, therefore I am" says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we are quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences."	Bertrand Russell	The Problems of Philosophy	2019-01-02 05:10:13.054051
2939	"Sky is not a limit for me; because I have no limit for myself in life. Because life is a world full of risk taking and possibilities. No matter how hard or easy life is; I will always find a way to enjoy myself; even in the mist of circumstances; because problems is a sense of adventure in sheep's clothing."	Temitope Owosela	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:13.311056
2940	"We do not pray for immortality, but only not to see our acts and all things stripped suddenly of all their meaning; for then it is the utter emptiness of everything reveals itself."	Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry	Night Flight	2019-01-02 05:10:13.570864

2942	"All that is transitory is but a metaphor."	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:14.086883
2943	"Perhaps love is a minor madness. And as with madness, it's unendurable alone. The one person who can relieve us is of course the sole person we cannot go to: the one we love. So instead we seek out allies, even among strangers and wives, fellow patients who, if they can't touch the edge of our particular sorrow, have felt something that cuts nearly as deep."	Andrew Sean Greer	The Story of a Marriage	2019-01-02 05:10:14.35724
2944	"On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness."	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:14.626161

2947	"What is meant here by saying that existence precedes essence? It means first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself. If man, as the existentialist conceives him, is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be."

2953	"The books we need are of the kind that act upon us like a misfortune,that makes us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves, that make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide,lost in a forest remote from all human habitation"	Franz Kafka	The Trial	2019-01-02 05:10:16.965997

2963	"At that time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowing overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it."	Albert Camus	The Stranger	2019-01-02 05:10:22.066319

2967	"Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon absolute truth.... Through words and concepts we shall never reach beyond the wall off relations, to some sort of fabulous primal ground of things."	Friedrich Nietzsche	Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks	2019-01-02 05:10:23.108299
2968	"There wasn't a single item of importance [in the newspaper]. A tower of illusion, all of it, made of illusory bricks and full of holes. If life were made up only of imporant things, it really would be a dangerous house of glass, scarcely to be handled carelessly. But everyday life was exactly like the headlines. And so everybody, knowing the meaninglessness of existence, sets the centre of his compass at his own home."	Abe KÅbÅ	The Woman in the Dunes	2019-01-02 05:10:23.373334
2969	"To stay or to go, it amounted to the same thing."	Albert Camus	The Stranger	2019-01-02 05:10:23.631834
2970	"The desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith, rather the opposite. If one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism: one is secure enough, fixed enough for it."	Friedrich Nietzsche	Twilight of the Idols	2019-01-02 05:10:23.900599

2994	"It is not in giving life but in risking life that man is raised above the animal; that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity no to the sex that brings forth but to that which kills."	Simone de Beauvoir	The Second Sex	2019-01-02 05:10:32.887674
2974	"Without knowledge of what I am and why I am here, it is impossible to live, and since I cannot know that, I cannot live either. In an infinity of time, in an infinity of matter, and an infinity of space a bubble-organism emerges while will exist for a little time and then burst, and that bubble am I."

2976	"Indeed, compulsive and rigid moralism arises in given persons precisely as the result of a lack of sense of being. Rigid moralism is a compensatory mechanism by which the individual persuades himself to take over the external sanctions because he has no fundamental assurance that his own choices have any sanction of their own"	Rollo May	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:25.734208
2977	"In comparison with capitalism, which reconstituted man as an economic animal; in comparison with Marxism, which found man an object made up of organized matter; in comparison with catholicism, which saw him as the unwitting plaything of an imperious unseen power (the Divine Will); in comparison with dialectical materialism, which saw him as unwitting plaything of the deterministic evolution of the means of production- existentialism made man a god"	Ali Shariati	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:25.992919

2979	"But what are a hundred million deaths? When one has served in a war, one hardly knows what a dead man is, after a while. And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination."	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:26.640985

2982	"When a lack of white blood cells exposes the horizon of being, one has to make a choice. To cloister yourself away in a germ-free environment, alive but alone, or to embrace the woman you love and catch your death of cold at the marriage ceremony? What a great show. Itâs inner-directed script was unmatched by any other soap opera."

2989	"What gave you this idea of an imperfect god?'  'I don't know. It seems quite feasible to me.

StanisÅaw Lem	Solaris	2019-01-02 05:10:31.573616
2990	"It seemed funny that one day I would go to bed in her arms and the next not feel anything, like a switch had gone off. But no, that wasnât honest either. This had been building for a long time. Our silences were getting longer. Our arguments more frequent. How do you stay with someone when there are no dreams to build? No purpose to accomplish? No meaning? No meaning âthat was the monster that drove us away from one another in the end. Always."	Steven L. Peck	A Short Stay in Hell	2019-01-02 05:10:31.834495

2997	"I want to see the world without explaining away its mystery by calling things wicked, righteous, sinful, and good. I want to erase in myself the easy explanations, the always mendacious explanations about why things happen the way they do, and in this way, come to know the mystery of beingâ-not by any approximation in thought, but by being. I want to be and not be ashamed of being."	Therese Doucet	A Lost Argument	2019-01-02 05:10:33.671795
2998	"In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of "world history"- yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."

3006	"There comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two make four is punished with death. The schoolteacher is well aware of this. And the question is not one of knowing what punishment or reward attends the making of this calculation. The question is that of knowing whether two and two do make four."	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:36.169124

3008	"Therefore, it is we who are responsible for much of the evil in the world; and we are each morally required to accept rather than project that ponderous responsibility-lest we prefer instead to wallow in a perennial state of powerless, frustrated, furious, victimhood.

3009	"All she had to do was make the simplest of gestures - open her hands and let go her hold. She lifted one hand and moved the fingers of it; they responded, in surprise and obedience, and this obedience of a thousand little unsuspected muscles was in itself a miracle. Why ask for more?"	Simone de Beauvoir	She Came to Stay	2019-01-02 05:10:36.949916
3010	"Integrity is unity of the personality; it implies being brutally honest with ourselves about our intentionality. Since intentionality is inextricably bound up with the daimonic, this is never an easy, nor always pleasant pursuit. But being willing to admit our daimonic tendencies - to know them consciously and to wisely oversee them - brings with it the invaluable blessing of freedom, vigor, inner strength, and self-acceptance."	Stephen A. Diamond	Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic	2019-01-02 05:10:37.220043
3011	"And, on a wide view, I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and tenâsince, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through, inevitably. Still, somehow this line of thought wasn't as consoling as it should have been; the idea of all those years of life in hand was a galling reminder!"

3020	"Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. One keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still there, nevertheless, and one hardly dares think of how he would feel if all this were taken away."	Soren Kieekegaard	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:42.049425

3024	"What is the ideal for mental health, then? A lived, compelling illusion that does not lie about life, death, and reality; one honest enough to follow its own commandments: I mean, not to kill, not to take the lives of others to justify itself."	Ernest Becker	\N	2019-01-02 05:10:43.084008
3025	"The Expulsion from Paradise is eternal in its principal aspect: this makes it irrevocable, and our living in this world inevitable, but the eternal nature of the process has the effect that not only could we remain forever in Paradise, but that we are currently there, whether we know it or not."

3058	"Man's first expression, like his first dream, was an aesthetic one. Speech was a poetic outcry rather than a demand for communication. Original man, shouting his consonants, did so in yells of awe and anger at his tragic state, at his own self-awareness and at his own helplessness before the void."

3069	"When one contemplated Portia, when one contemplated Sharon, when one contemplated one's own apparently pointless, utterly trivial being, the questions hung all around one, as urgent as knives at the throat.

3093	"In the frame of the human, maybe too human, order of the world, which the New Age Enlightenment set as the horizon of the future, there is no more space for any superhuman justification, nor for any superhuman construction of the human existence. The enlightened man freed himself of every divine tutelage, he radically diverged from every mythic restriction.

If you ask them what they did yesterday, they don't get flustered; they tell you all about it in a few words. If I were in their place, I'd start stammering. It's true that for a long time now nobody has bothered how I spend my time. When you live alone, you even forget what it is to tell a story : plausibility disappears at the same time as friends."

But thatâs precisely what makes us humans â we make sense out of chaos, and in that sense we produce meaningfulness.

3201	"To act is literally to manifest preference about one set of possibilities, contrasted with an infinite set of alternatives. If we wish to live, we must act. Acting, we value."	Jordan Peterson	\N	2019-01-02 05:11:42.898782
3202	"The world itself, whose single meaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational. If one could only say just once: âThis is clear,â all would be saved. But these men vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is chaos, that all man has is his lucidity and his definite knowledge of the walls surrounding him. All these experiences agree and confirm one another."	Albert Camus	The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays	2019-01-02 05:11:43.171868
3204	"The vitality of the ordinary members of society is dependent on its Outsiders. Many Outsiders unify themselves, realize themselves as poets or saints. Others remain tragically divided and unproductive, but even they supply soul-energy to society; it is their strenuousness that purifies thought and prevents the bourgeois world from foundering under its own dead-weight; they are societyâs spiritual dynamos."	Colin Wilson	The Outsider	2019-01-02 05:11:43.704301
3205	"Ultimately, beyond the primordial, brutish labels of man-made institutions, true practical religion of the civilized society must bring oneness. This very process of unification without bigotry is what makes religion, religion, for the word religion comes from the latin "religare", which means "to bind", that is to unify humanity."

3207	"For instance, there is something new about my hands, a certain way of picking up my pipe or fork. Or else it's the fork which now has a certain way of having itself picked up, I don't know. A little while ago, just as I was coming into my room, I stopped short because I felt in my hand a cold object which held my attention through a sort of personality. I opened my hand, looked: I was simply holding the door-knob."	Jean-Paul Sartre	Nausea	2019-01-02 05:11:44.503759

3214	"To seek out the upright. No fall but preceded by a declination. He took great marching steps into the nothingness, counting them against his return. Eyes closed, arms oaring. Upright to what? Something nameless in the night, lode or matrix. To which he and the stars were common satellite. Like the great pendulum in its rotunda scribing through the long day movements of the universe of which you may say it knows nothing and yet know it must."	Cormac McCarthy	The Road	2019-01-02 05:11:46.34308
3215	"If we put away all the etymological jargon and destroy all self-created images and technical descriptions, then it is as simple as this - a moral being is a good being - a religious being - a conscientious being - a wise being."	Abhijit Naskar	Morality Absolute	2019-01-02 05:11:46.601672
3216	"THREE BASIC TRUTHS  THREE BASIC TRUTHS  Three things have a limited threshold: Time, pain, and death. While truth, love, and knowledge â Are boundless.

3227	"If one shifts the center of gravity of life out of life into the âBeyondâ â into nothingness â one has deprived life as such of its center of gravity.

3228	"I am poorâyou are my riches; darkâyou are my light; I own nothing, need nothing. And how could I own anything? After all, it is a contradiction that he can own something who does not own himself. I am happy as a child who is neither able to own anything nor allowed to.

3237	"Time makes us grow old, but it also gives us the day and the night...Lying is a bad thing. It makes you sorry you were ever born. And not to have been born is a curse.

A sense of repulsion had invested all the bodies in movement, their bone structure, the frenzy that shook them. How poorly made we are, she thought, how insufficient. The broad shoulders, the arms, the legs, the ears, noses, eyes, seemed to her attributes of monstrous beings who had fallen from some corner of the black sky."	Elena Ferrante	My Brilliant Friend	2019-01-02 05:12:10.279622
3277	"Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom brings about is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion."	SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:10.542815

3285	"I wonder if there has been a book written on toesâthe bottom parts of a body are just as important as the top parts.

In this way the noble life stands opposed to the common or inert life, which reclines statically upon itself, condemned to perpetual immobility, unless an external force compels it to come out of itself. Hence we apply the term mass to this kind of man- not so much because of his multitude as because of his inertia."	Ortega y Gasset	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:26.90876

3337	"The law of karma says that no matter what context I find myself in, it is neither my parents, nor my science teacher, nor the mailman, but I alone who have brought myself into this state because of my past actions. Instead of trapping me in a fatalistic snare, this gives me freedom. Because I alone have brought myself into my present condition, I myself, by working hard and striving earnestly, can reach the supreme state which is nirvana."

3339	"I was still keenly aware as in my childhood of the inexplicable nature of my presence here on earth; where had I come from here; where was I going? I often thought about these things with a kind of stupefied horror and used to fill my diary with long self-communings"	Simone de Beauvoir	Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter	2019-01-02 05:12:31.317511
3340	"No drugs here, no manipulation of neurotransmitters that leaves our worldly problems unattended. And no talking cures because explicit insight is not needed. All that is required is courage: the courage to encounter discomfort and stay with it long enough to be changed by it, strengthened."	Jason Dias	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:31.573638

3356	"The whole composition reminds him of something he once had and that he isn't sure if he misses. He does and he doesn't at the same time. It is less the melancholy memory of an abscence and more the comforting evidence that it exists and is still part of the world."	Daniel Galera	Barba Ensopada de Sangue	2019-01-02 05:12:35.724149
3357	"Once you set the bar high for yourself, you cannot go back to mediocrity. You must give world-class performance in all that you do. Your work ethic, persistence, effort and dedication will glow on your behalf. Do not brag about your accomplishments; allow your reputation to speak of your magnificence."	Luis Enrique Cavazos	The Five Virtues That Awaken Your Life	2019-01-02 05:12:35.98649
3358	"Hope is an all seeing eye that triangles the eternal humbleness in our existence. Hope is what makes us smile through our unwavering faith. When we hope, we organize our details to become conscious citizens of the world."	Luis Enrique Cavazos	The Five Virtues That Awaken Your Life	2019-01-02 05:12:36.244679
3359	"To fully appreciate the depth of love, we must captivate ourselves in the moment. Whether it is fate or humanism, it produces a great capacity for happiness with a throw in of anxiety, grief, and isolation. Use those whales as an insidious beginning to produce meaning and humility in your life."	Luis Enrique Cavazos	The Five Virtues That Awaken Your Life	2019-01-02 05:12:36.509771
3360	"What is meant here by saying that existence precedes essence? It means that, first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself.... Not only is man what he conceives himself to be, but he is also only what he wills himself to be after this thrust toward existence.   Whereas a table is a table is a table, humans have no preexisting essence and so define themselves,"	Gordon Marino	Ethics: The Essential Writings	2019-01-02 05:12:36.775977
3362	"I wanted to explain myself to myself in an understandable way. I gave shape to my fears and made excuses. I varied my velocities, watched myselves sleep. Something's not right about what I'm doing but I'm still doing it-- living in the worst parts, ruining myself. My inner life is a sheet of black glass. If I fell through the floor I would keep falling.  The enormity of my desire disgusts me."	Richard Siken	War of the Foxes	2019-01-02 05:12:39.605263
3363	"You are only excused for happiness and success if you generously agree to share them. But if one is to be happy, one should not worry too much about other people - which means there is no way out.  Happy and judged or absolved and miserable."	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:39.870077

3365	"Atheists are the most honest of the human race. These people are unable to live a double life; they are unable to lie to themselves. Of course it's an evolutionary handicap, and if that handicap was widespread, our species would run the risk of extinction"	Bangambiki Habyarimana	Pearls Of Eternity	2019-01-02 05:12:40.409504

3386	"An atheist is someone who is disappointed in his search of god. He is a man who strongly needed god but couldn't find him. Atheism is a cry of despair"	Bangambiki Habyarimana	Pearls Of Eternity	2019-01-02 05:12:46.098032

3371	"Although we amplify our cognitive degree of awareness and enhance our appreciation for life experiences by maturing, it also brings us death. Facing a certain death forces a person to examine the worthiness of continuing to live."	Kilroy J. Oldster	Dead Toad Scrolls	2019-01-02 05:12:42.12762
3372	"God! when you think of all the things you could do and yet somehow never do! All the opportunities you let slip by! The idea, the inspiration just doesn't come fast enough. Instead of being open, you're closed up tight. Thats's the worst sin of all - the sin of omission."	Simone de Beauvoir	The Mandarins	2019-01-02 05:12:42.395223
3373	"Don't create unbelief or doubt in people's minds. When you do so you ruin their lives and you have nothing to give them in its place. It's ok if people delude themselves; those delusions keep their day running."	Bangambiki Habyarimana	Pearls Of Eternity	2019-01-02 05:12:42.666499

3380	"The greatest events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness, and, when one thinks of them, become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow out in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion. We reject the burden of their memory, and have anodynes against them. But the little things, the things of no moment, remain with us."	Oscar Wilde	The Portrait of Mr. W. H.	2019-01-02 05:12:44.500919
3382	"My world today is raw, it is a world of great vital difficulty. Because, more than a star, today I want the thick and black root of the stars, I want the source that always seems dirty, and is dirty, and that is always incomprehensible.  It is with pain that I bid farewell even to the beauty of a child - I want the adult who is more primitive and ugly and drier and more difficult, and who became a child-seed that cannot be broken between the teeth."	Clarice Lispector	The Passion According to G.H.	2019-01-02 05:12:45.034596
3383	"I want the material of things. Humanity is drenched with humanization, as if that were necessary; and that false humanization trips up man and trips up his humanity. A thing exists that is fuller, deafer, deeper, less good, less bad, less pretty. Yet that thing too runs the risk, in our coarse hands, of becoming transformed into "purity", our hands that are coarse and full of words."

3394	"The memory of having sat at someoneâs feet will later make you want to trample him underfoot. Iâm trying to fend off your admiration for me, you see, in order to save myself from your future contempt. I prefer to put up with my present state of loneliness rather than suffer more loneliness later. We who are born into this age of freedom and independence and the self must undergo this loneliness. Itâs the price we pay for these times of ours."	Natsume SÅseki	Kokoro	2019-01-02 05:12:50.327533

3400	"The existentialists' view of love is not romantic, because they do not believe in love as an abstract force or amorous sunset walks along the beach. However, Cox also said, "if your idea of romance is somewhat more gothic and stormy, full of heartache, yearning and the thwarted desire to possess breaking up, making up and breaking up again, tears before bedtime and tears in the rain, then maybe it is romantic"."	Skye Cleary	Existentialism and Romantic Love	2019-01-02 05:12:52.051291
3401	"People die all the time. Life is a lot more fragile than we think. So you should treat others in a way that leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely. It's too easy not to make the effort, then weep and wring your hands after the person dies. Personally, I don't buy it." Yuki leaned against the car door. "But that's real hard, isn't it?" she said. "Real hard," I said. "But it's worth trying for."	Haruki Murakami	Dance Dance Dance	2019-01-02 05:12:52.327176

3407	"(About Sartre...) His death does not separate us. My death will not bring us together again. That is how things are. It is in itself splendid that we were able to live our lives in harmony for so long."	Simone de Beauvoir	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:53.902921
3408	"No more Guernicas, no more Auschwitzes, no more Hiroshimas, no more Setifs. Hooray! But what about the impossibility of living, what about this stifling mediocrity and this absence of passion? What about the jealous fury in which the rankling of never being ourselves drives us to imagine that other people are happy? What about this feeling of never really being inside your own skin?"	Raoul Vaneigem	The Revolution of Everyday Life	2019-01-02 05:12:54.166226
3409	"I know by my own experience how, from a stranger met by chance, there may come an irresistible appeal which overturns the habitual perspectives just as a gust of wind might tumble down the panels of a stage set - what had seemed near becomes infinitely remote and what had seemed distant seems to be close."	Gabriel Marcel	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:54.426386
3410	"There is no always," I say. "Nothing persists forever." "Nothingness persists," she says. She is testing me. "No. So long as anything exists, nothingness is impossible. In fact, it's nothingness that cannot persist. Nothingness gives way to somethingness. The nothingness that preceded the Big Bang was obliterated. Nothing became something."	Michael  Grant	Eve & Adam	2019-01-02 05:12:54.691274
3411	"Iâve done everything I wanted to do, writing books, learning about things, but Iâve been swindled all the same because itâs never anything more."	Simone de Beauvoir	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:54.962791
3415	"Life is short and evasive. This shortness and evasiveness of life is not predicated on numeric quantifiers, but embedded in the limitation on humans as mere mortals."	Prinx Maurice	\N	2019-01-02 05:12:56.073102
3417	"Whatever may be the position of science, whatever may be the position of philosophy, as long as there is such a thing as death in the world, as long as there is such a thing as weakness in the human heart, as long as the human heart sheds a drop of tear in weakness, there shall be a faith in God and divinity."

3419	"And think about the precise meaning of that term: a Narcissus is not proud. A proud man has disdain for other people, he undervalues them. The Narcissus overvalues them, because in every person's eyes he sees his own image, and wants to embellish it. So he takes nice care of all his mirrors."	Milan Kundera	The Festival of Insignificance	2019-01-02 05:12:59.386362

3421	"That's the existential problem," Fat said, "based on the concept that We are what we do, rather than, We are what we think. It finds its first expression in Goethe's Faust, Part One, where Faust says, 'Im Anfang war das Wort'. He's quoting the opening of the Fourth Gospel; 'In the beginning was the Word.' Faust says, 'Nein. Im Anfang war die Tat.' In the beginning was the Deed. From this, all existentialism comes."	Philip K. Dick	VALIS	2019-01-02 05:13:00.049777

3427	"Existentialism's first move is to make every man aware of what he is and to make the full responsibility of his existence rest on him."	Jean-Paul Sartre	Existentialism and Human Emotions	2019-01-02 05:13:01.788859

3429	"We get sombre about death. Think about Charon the ferryman rowing the souls across the Styx to the Isle of the Dead. Pretty grim stuff. Unless you think that, perhaps, at times, old Charon rows souls back to the land of the living too. Perhaps I have merely gone to rest awhileâ¦"	Sean J Halford	Stronger Than Lions	2019-01-02 05:13:02.304734

3431	"Every novel says to the reader: âThings are not as simple as you think.â That is the novelâs eternal truth, but it grows steadily harder to hear amid the din of easy, quick answers that come faster than the question and block it off. In the spirit of our time, itâs either Anna or Karenin who is right, and the ancient wisdom of Cervantes, telling us about the difficulty of knowing and the elusiveness of truth, seems cumbersome and useless."	Milan Kundera	The Art of the Novel	2019-01-02 05:13:02.837034
3432	"Itâs tragic that most of us spend our private lives paradoxically thinking something is watching us and permanently disapproving. We say we believe in benevolent deities but smear them with hate and the power to smite. We see sin everywhere, when the only sin is when we forget to treat each other with respect. That is the sad secret that makes the Universe vulnerable."	Sean J Halford	Stronger Than Lions	2019-01-02 05:13:03.098067
3433	"Sometimes itâs like that in life too. We look into a past that no longer exists, looking as if itâs real. We hold onto things in our life that thereâs no reason to hold onto anymore because, unlike the stars, they donât bring us beauty, they bring us pain."

3438	"Iâve whittled my fascination with the cosmos down to this mantra: we can imagine the Universe as a giant void racing away from us at a frightening speed, or it could occur to us that, in fact, it is wrapped around us in all directions. Then, no matter where we are, we are at the centre of something wonderful. And thatâs how Iâve always thought about it."	Sean J Halford	Stronger Than Lions	2019-01-02 05:13:04.806415
3439	"Tears are a wonderful thing; they wash, they warm, they are the rivers that run through our minds, seeking release. In their salinity they remind us that we came from the sea. Our cells know this, and go about their machinations, ceaselessly recreating the primordial brine. We are water, whether or not the Spirit of God once hovered formless and magnificent above the idea of us, in some ancient place before the Singularity uncoiled itself into space and time."

3447	"She wants to have her notebooks so that the flimsy framework of events, as she has constructed them in her school notebook, will be provided with walls and become a house she can live in. Because if the tottering structure of her memories collapses like a clumsily pitched tent, all that Tamina will be left with is the present, that invisible point, that nothingness moving slowly toward death."

3471	"In the real journey of life, it is not what you do; it is what you don't do that matters the most."	Harshit Walia	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:15.514482
3452	"â¦one lives and analyses data within a frame, unaware that the solution is most often just outside of that frame. Never underestimate the depth of your subjectivity."	Darrell Calkins	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:10.570206
3454	"We can't even resist making antimatter, so what makes you think we are going to leave cloning technology untapped? (Douglas Parsley)"	Alan Chains	Return to Island X	2019-01-02 05:13:11.093888

3457	"In order to exist just once in the world, it is necessary never again to exist."	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:11.872738
3458	"You didn't succeed. Well, what of that? There's nothing to prove, you know, and the revolution's not a question of virtue but of effectiveness. There is no heaven. There's work to be done, that's all. And you must do what you're cut out for; all the better if it comes easy to you. The best work is not the work that takes the most sacrifice. It's the work in which you can best succeed."	Jean-Paul Sartre	No Exit and Three Other Plays	2019-01-02 05:13:12.137218
3460	"Amid the pointing and the horror, the clean flame."	William Faulkner	The Sound and the Fury	2019-01-02 05:13:12.657494
3463	"He did not look up because he knew how senseless the landscape would appear. It takes energy to invest life with meaning, and at present this energy was lacking."	Paul Bowles	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:13.4529
3464	"In a single wave of meaning the triumphant purity of being."	Boris Pasternak	Doctor Zhivago	2019-01-02 05:13:13.719759
3474	"People see the cleverness of nature and suppose it's the cleverness of the animal itself but it was obvious to me that each and every segment of the animal isn't aware. How much I'd hate to live totally unaware of myself, I thought. What would be the point of living, of existing, if you weren't ever to know about it? I looked at the Fox Moth and pitied it, poor unconscious creature. But then, I supposed, at least it wouldn't be disappointed. It would never find out."	Poppy Adams	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:16.309378
3476	"Anita felt like she finally understood why love was symbolized by the grotesque pumping organ, always threatening to clog, or break, or attack. Because the heart was the body's engine, and love was an act of the body. Your mind could tell you who to hate or respect or envy, but only your body--your nostrils and your mouth and the wide, blank canvas of your skin--could tell you who to love."	Tommy Wallach	We All Looked Up	2019-01-02 05:13:18.736215
3477	"She was like a landscape you see from the train, and you want to stop just there."	Graham Greene	The Living Room	2019-01-02 05:13:19.000143
3478	"Even at a time like this, the street is bright enough and filled with people coming and goingâpeople with places to go and people with no place to go; people with a purpose and people with no purpose; people trying to hold time back and people trying to urge it forward."	Haruki Murakami	After Dark	2019-01-02 05:13:19.271768
3479	"There is no reasonable doubt that existentialism will soon become the predominant philosophical current among bourgeois intellectuals." (1949)"	GyÃ¶rgy LukÃ¡cs	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:19.535432

3483	"We are, for all our polish, of little stature, and, as human lives, compared with authentic martyrs, of no account."	W.H. Auden	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:20.610621
3484	"The sky both exists and doesnât exist. It has substance and at the same time doesnât. And we merely accept that vast expanse and drink it in."	Haruki Murakami	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:20.872108
3485	"A picture was a motionless record of motion. An arrested representation of life. A picture was the kiss of death pretending to possess immutability."	Ivan KlÃ­ma	Waiting for the Dark, Waiting for the Light	2019-01-02 05:13:21.127385
3487	"Life is rather a short walk through eternity. Be they seeds, pups or infants, on the trek all pick up weight, sensitivity and awareness. Then, much before the end of the run, they deteriorate, head, legs and lungs. The tragicomedy of existence: the long walk of slow decay."	Dagobert D. Runes	A Dictionary of Thought	2019-01-02 05:13:21.679915
3488	"You know, everything's a sort of lie, and then you die."	Arthur K. Flam	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:21.93533
3489	"The cultural problem was 'the fallacy of insignificance', and it was a philosophical form of this fallacy that had somehow landed existentialism in a cul de sac."	Colin Wilson	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:22.200308
3493	"All I can tell you with certainty is that I, for one, have no self, and that I am unwilling or unable to perpetrate upon myself the joke of a self.... What I have instead is a variety of impersonations I can do, and not only of myself â a troupe of players that I have internalised, a permanent company of actors that I can call upon when a self is required.... I am a theater and nothing more than a theater."	Philip Roth	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:23.261889
3494	"The tree of possibilities: life as it reveals itself to a man arriving, astonished, at the threshold of his adult life: an abundant treetop canopy filled with bees singing. And he thinks he understands why she never showed him the letters: she wanted to hear the murmur of the tree by herself, without him, because he, Jean-Marc, represented the abolition of all possibilities, he was the reduction, (even though it was a happy reduction) of her life to a single possibility."	Milan Kundera	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:23.520692

3543	"What is the point of our lives? There isn't any. I can't seem to decide how much horror and how much joy lies within that simple truth, but I know it is both of those things at once."	Ashly Lorenzana	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:41.113552

3502	"The awkwardness of getting reward in a well-off society is that the creation of appetite often requires undoing the work of satisfying appetite."	George Ainslie	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:25.6571
3503	"This existenitalist stuff sure is crap"	Daniel Younger	Delirious	2019-01-02 05:13:25.923928
3504	"Without your stories, without your heroes and their awesome powers, how could you explain this, this here, this incomprehensible real that ever refuses to embrace any rule, any clichÃ© besides the intransigent, pathetic truth that we all end, that no one comes back."	Tom King	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:26.182366
3508	"I was dead for a billion of years and in a few years I will be dead again. I'm not conscious of that state of lifelessness which was before I came to life. And I'm not sure about the lifelessness that is yet to come. Life is only a station between these two states. It is a chance to experience and to do something, the only chance known with certainty. The major issue is to find what is worth living for, but an even greater issue is to find what is worth dying for. We all die anyway."	Huseyn Raza	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:29.408338
3510	"We are children of chaos, and the deep structure of change is decay. At root, there is only corruption, and the unstemmable tide of chaos. Gone is purpose; all that is left is direction. This is the bleakness we have to accept as we peer deeply and dispassionately into the heart of the Universe."	Peter Atkins	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:29.937272
3544	"The combination of our mortality with our groundlessness imparts to human life its pressing and enigmatic character. We struggle to in our brief time in the midst of an impenetrable darkness. A small area is lighted up: our civilizations, our sciences, our loves. We prove unable to define the place of the lighted area within a larger space devoid of light, and must go to our deaths unenlightened."	Roberto Mangabeira Unger	The Religion of the Future	2019-01-02 05:13:41.370484
3545	"A kind of joy came upon him, as if borne in on a summer breeze. He dimly recalled that he had been thinking of failure-as if it mattered. It seemed to him now that such thoughts were mean, unworthy of what his life had been."	John  Williams	Stoner	2019-01-02 05:13:41.642179
3513	"Someone's got to do some more research, but I would really like to know: when a CBT therapist really gets distressed, who does he go see?"	Irvin D. Yalom	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:30.7083
3514	"I relish my life. Itâs the one I have. Itâs difficult, beautiful, painful, full of laughter, passing strange. Whatever else it is, whatever it brings â itâs mine."	Marya Hornbacher	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:30.962665
3516	"God desires that man should be. God does not wish to be alone. The meaning of existence is the conquest of loneliness, the acquisition of kinship and nearness."	Nikolai A. Berdyaev	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:31.48301
3518	"This is the world, he thought. And I am in it."	Nick Harkaway	Tigerman	2019-01-02 05:13:32.00861

3521	"I really should have died then, Tsukuru often told himself. Then this world, the one in the here and now, wouldn't exist. It was a captivating, bewitching thought. The present world wouldn't exist, and reality would no longer be real. As far as this world was concerned, he would simply no longer existâjust as this world would no longer exist for him."	haruki murakami	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:32.805234
3526	"If the existentialists are right, that life is meaningless, and if we acknowledge that, we are better equipped to find pleasure in small things."	Chloe Thurlow	A Girl's Adventure	2019-01-02 05:13:34.133302
3528	"I say, we live on, though I am wrong, this is what I say. In the past, present, future, we live on as if in one time. You can never stop the past from happening, and it has happened , and will continue to happen.  This is the truth, I think I know, along with  the two other things I do know. I exist. I want to kiss you.   And also this: each day, as we go, we will always be as young as we can be."	Derek Keck	The Kitchen Sinks of Yesterday Morning: The Urinal Cakes of Tomorrow	2019-01-02 05:13:34.658954
3529	"If we tried to rely entirely on reason and pressed it hard, our lives and beliefs would collapse â a form of madness that may actually occur if the inertial force of taking the world and life for granted is somehow lost. If we lose our grip on that, reason will not give it back to us."	Thomas Nagel	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:34.915986
3531	"Is the ash in trees, babies, flowers, and visions of God better than the visions themselves? Then you think, none of this is tangible or concrete. So you have another cigarette and think about the (not one) but many ghosts you keep tucked away, under sheets, under beds, in notes, within other ghosts."	Derek Keck	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:35.437656
3532	"Heâs a typical existentialist. And thatâs a contradiction in terms if ever there was one."	Johnny Rich	The Human Script	2019-01-02 05:13:35.70518
3533	"Since we are nothing but packages of tepid, half-rotted viscera, we shall always have trouble with sentiment. Being in love is nothing, itâs sticking together thatâs difficult. Faeces on the other hand make no attempt to endure or to grow. On this score we are far more unfortunate than shit: our frenzy to persist in our present state â thatâs the unconscionable torture."	Louis Ferdinand CÃ©line	Voyage au bout de la nuit	2019-01-02 05:13:35.960701
3534	"There is no reality except in action. Man is nothing else than his plan; he exists only to the extent that he fulfills himself; he is therefore nothing else than the ensemble of his acts, nothing else than his life."	Jean-Paul Sartre	Existentialism Is a Humanism	2019-01-02 05:13:38.28514
3536	"I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy"	Albert Camus	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:38.943311
3537	"I've lived the life of a man without teeth, he thought about it. A life of a man without teeth. I've never bitten, I've been waiting, keeping myself for later - and now I've just ascertained that I don't have teeth anymore."	Jean-Paul Sartre	The Age of Reason	2019-01-02 05:13:39.206493
3538	"Information paints no picture, sings no song, and writes no poem."	R.F. Georgy	Notes from the Cafe	2019-01-02 05:13:39.465048
3540	"[W]hat we also see in sex is a kind of submissiveness. But not a kind of submissiveness which is simply 'do what you like, I'm just here for you', but it...is, or can be, very manipulative. It is a way of getting the other person to exercise all his or her efforts towards pleasing you, and in that way controlling what they're thinking, and in particular what they're thinking of you."	Robert C. Solomon	No Excuses: Existentialism And The Meaning Of Life	2019-01-02 05:13:40.120552
3547	"We have an infinite supply of information and yet we cannot read."	R.F. Georgy	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:42.167582
3551	"Live with the consequences of your deeds and enjoy the warmth they create. The only warmth in the cold, indifferent universe is that which we create ourselves. And that is what a work of art is, it is what a constructed life is, a fulfilled life, the warmth of acts."	Peter Watson	The Age of Atheists: How We Have Sought to Live Since the Death of God	2019-01-02 05:13:43.245818
3553	"So we must run back and forth between these two suns in our firmamentâthe presentiment of death and awareness of lifeâand avoid being transfixed by either of them. If we are lucky in this uncertain middle distance, we may form attachments and projects that enhance the sentiment of life. However, even as we try our luck, death comes to us, and brings our experiment to a end."	Roberto Mangabeira Unger	The Religion of the Future	2019-01-02 05:13:43.784731
3554	"Insofar we are death-bound, existence is urgent and frightful. Insofar as are groundless, it is vertiginous and dreamlike. Insofar as we are insatiable, it is unquiet and tormented."	Roberto Mangabeira Unger	The Religion of the Future	2019-01-02 05:13:44.041233
3556	"The embodied self is the same person who woke to the world in a burst of visonary immediacy, who soon found that he was not the center of that world but on the contrary, a dependent and even hapless creature, and who then discovered that he was doomed to die"	Roberto Mangabeira Unger	The Religion of the Future	2019-01-02 05:13:44.575488
3558	"Modern Existentialism... is a total European creation, perhaps the last philosophic legacy of Europe to America or whatever other civilization is now on its way to supplant Europe."	William Barrett	Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy	2019-01-02 05:13:45.104389
3560	"A sense of his own identity came upon him with sudden force, and he felt the power of it. He was himself, and he knew what he had been."	John Williams	\N	2019-01-02 05:13:45.621901
